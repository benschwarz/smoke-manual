# Introduction

Smoke is a DSL written in Ruby. Its primary goal is to be a very simple interface to query many online sources, chop them up into usable pieces and use them in ways that the source provider may have never imagined.

This document is aimed to serve as a guide for usage to get you started.

## The concept
The concept comes from using [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com) to make web based mash ups: Get a list of tv shows for my torrent client, compile a recipe book or make tools to give me a list of albums that artists in my music library are about to be released.
